*Contributor agreement*

Thank you for your interest in contributing to [The Commons
Conservancy]. [The Commons Conservancy] is a not-for-profit organisation
managing the rights of free and open technology development and of
associated materials in the interest of global user communities. [The
Commons Conservancy] tries to manage many different scenarios on behalf
of its Programmes, such as future merging and forking of software code
bases, approved reuse of documentation materials in publications with
incompatible licenses, translations, transfer to a standalone legal
entity when one of its Programmes establishes an independent
not-for-profit and other actions. Allowing [The Commons Conservancy] to
hold the broadest possible exclusive license in Your Contribution will
enable it to protect the long term interests of the communities it
serves in the best possible way.
The purpose of this contributor agreement ("Agreement") is to clarify
and document the rights granted by contributors to [The Commons
Conservancy] (throughout this document referred to as: "We" or "Us").

to us a worldwide, royalty- free, non-exclusive, perpetual and
irrevocable (except as stated in Section 3.2) patent license, with the
right to transfer an unlimited number of non-exclusive licenses or to
grant sublicenses to third parties, to make, have made, use, sell, offer
for sale, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution and the
Contribution in combination with the Material (and portions of such
combination). This license applies to all patents owned or controlled by
You, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be
infringed by making, having made, using, selling, offering for sale,
importing or otherwise transferring of Your Contribution(s) alone or by
combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Material.

3.2 Revocation of Patent License
You reserve the right to revoke the patent license stated in section 3.1
if we make any infringement claim that is targeted at your Contribution
and not asserted for a Defensive Purpose. An assertion of claims of the
Patents shall be considered for a "Defensive Purpose" if the claims are
asserted against an entity that has filed, maintained, threatened, or
voluntarily participated in a patent infringement lawsuit against Us or
any of Our licensees.

4. Third-party Materials
You hereby declare that You are not aware of, nor will seek any
involvement with, any third parties holding patents, copyright or other
rights that would be infringed due to your Submitting to the Material to Us.

5. Disclaimer
The contribution is provided "AS IS". more particularly, all express or
implied warranties including, without limitation, any implied WARRANTY
OF MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE are expressly
DISCLAIMED by You to Us and by Us to You. To the extent that any such
warranties cannot be disclaimed, such warranty is limited in duration to
the minimum period permitted by law.

6. Consequential Damage Waiver
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will You
or Us be liable for any loss of profits, loss of anticipated savings,
loss of data, indirect, special, incidental, consequential and exemplary
damages arising out of this agreement regardless of the legal or
equitable theory (contract, tort or otherwise) upon which the claim is
based.
If the disclaimer and damage waiver mentioned in section 5 and section 6
cannot be given legal effect under applicable local law, reviewing
courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute
waiver of all civil liability in connection with the contribution.

8. Term
This Agreement shall come into effect upon Your acceptance of the terms
and conditions.
In the event of a termination of this Agreement Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and
9 shall survive such termination and shall remain in full force
thereafter. For the avoidance of doubt, Contributions that are already
licensed under a free and open source license at the date of the
termination shall remain in full force after the termination of this
Agreement.

9. Miscellaneous
This Agreement and all disputes, claims, actions, suits or other
proceedings arising out of this agreement or relating in any way to it
shall be governed by the laws of the Netherlands excluding its private
international law provisions.

This Agreement sets out the entire agreement between You and Us for Your
Contributions to Us and overrides all other agreements or understandings.
If any provision of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, such
provision will be replaced to the extent possible with a provision that
comes closest to the meaning of the original provision and that is
enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall
apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of this Agreement
or any limited remedy to the maximum extent possible under law.
You agree to notify Us of any facts or circumstances of which you become
aware that would make this Agreement inaccurate in any respect.

10. Programmes You wish to contribute to
Please list the Programme(s) within [The Commons Conservancy] that You
are Submitting your Contribution and the entire work of authorship to:
eduVPN (aka Let's Connect! VPN)

You understand that during the lifetime of the Programme(s) it may Fork
or (partially) Merge with other Programmes, if such is possible
according to the statutes and regulations of the Programme(s) involved.
These direct (lineal) descendants and confusions are all considered to
be parallel futures of the current Programme(s). Therefore, the above
list of names of receiving Programme(s) is considered to also include
any potential direct (lineal) future descendants of the Programme(s)
listed by You as well as any potential future confusion (such as
Merging) of Programme(s) into which the governing body or governing
bodies of the Programme(s) involved may decide to enter into. You can at
any point in time decide to revoke this agreement for future
contributions, and replace it at Your choice with a new agreement
containing another list of recipients to share Your contributions with.
